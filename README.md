# 🧮 Arithmetic Operators in C++

## 📘 Description
This program demonstrates the use of **arithmetic operators** in C++.  
It allows the user to input two numbers and performs all basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.

## ⚙️ Operators Covered
- `+` → Addition  
- `-` → Subtraction  
- `*` → Multiplication  
- `/` → Division  
- `%` → Modulus  

## 🧠 Example Output
Enter two numbers: 10 3
<br>
Addition = 13
<br>
Subtraction = 7
<br>
Multiplication = 30
<br>
Division = 3.33333
<br>
Modulus = 1
